Screen RAM organization
-----------------------
Starts at 0x2000. Each line consists of a terminator (0x7f) followed by
two bytes of address and attributes:

 7 | 6 5 | 4 | 3 2 1 0 | 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
---|-----|---|---------|--------------
 S | AA  | M | addr    | addr

* S == 1 if part of scrolling region
* AA == 11 if normal atrributes
* M == 1 if ram starting at 0x2000, M = 0 if ram starting at 0x4000 (?)
* addr == low bits of address

Relevant port addresses
-----------------------

Location  | R/W | Description
----------|-----|------------
0x00      | R/W | PUSART data bus
0x01      | R/W | PUSART command port
0x02      |  W  | Baud rate generator
0x42      |  W  | Brightness D/A latch
0x42      |  R  | Flags buffer
0x62      |  W  | Non-volatile memory latch
0x82      |  W  | Keyboard write
0x82      |  R  | Keyboad read
0xA2      |  W  | vid. proc. DC012
0xC2      |  W  | vid. proc. DC011

There is no even field mystery. It was the LBA 7 (also known as the NVR clock) all along!

NVRAM interactions
------------------
C1, C2, and C3 are the command pins on the ER1400 data sheet.

Bits in the NVR memory latch port:

* data is D0
* C1 is D1
* C2 is D2
* C3 is D3
* !SPDS is D5

Accept address high, accept address low, standby, read, standby, (accept data is standby?)
22 23x9 22 23x9 0x2f 0x2d 0x2f 0x25 0x2f 0x30 0x23

Flags buffer
------------

Bit  | Active? | Description
-----|---------|------------
7    | H       | KBD Transmit Buffer Empty
6    | H       | LBA 7(?) (It's a pin on the backplane connector...) - used to clock NVR - line buffer address
5    | H       | NVR DATA
4    | L       | EVEN FIELD (comes out of the video timing generator)
3    | H       | OPTION PRESENT (terminal output option???)
2    | L       | GRAPHICS FLAG (is VT52 graphics card present)
1    | L       | ADVANCED VIDEO (is AVO present) 
0    | H       | XMIT FLAG

Interrupt vector
----------------

Location  |  Purpose
----------|--------------
0x00      | Startup
0x08      | Keyboard interrupt
0x10      | Receiver
0x18      | Keyboard interrupt and receiver
0x20      | Vertical frequency
0x28      | Vertical frequency and keyboard interrupt
0x30      | Vertical frequency and receiver
0x38      | Vertical frequency and keyboard interrupt and receiver

Other addresses are bitwise combinations of these interrupts! Crazy.

Convenience Functions in ROM
----------------------------

Label  |   Description
-------|----------------------
0x13de |  add A to HL
0x02a4 |  init: zero all RAM above stack
0x038b |  memmov: copy B bytes from DE to HL
0x1083 |  memset: set DE bytes starting at HL to B

Control Function Parser
-----------------------

Scans for characters in the FIFO in the control range (<0x20 or 0x7f).

8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus.
8228 breaks devices on bus into write-only and bidirectional/read-only busses.

LXI LIST
--------

All value loads that could be addresses:

Address | Instruction | Description
--------|-------------|------------
 0x01c3 | `lxi h,X0815` | ???
        | `lxi h, 020e` | ??? right after loads keymapping table
 0x0431 | `lxi b,X0113` | (then call 0f7e,0e47)
 0x05af | `lxi h,X05b8` | (then jmp a18) // Likely table? (but subsequent code at 5b8 is valid)
 0x0c64 | `lxi h,X05ad` | (then jmp a18) // ... less likely table, feels like a chain
 0x0c7a | `lxi h,X0c8a` | (feels like a table)

STP -- Standard Terminal Port
-----------------------------

This is an edge connector on the main board that contains breakout points for
the RS232 and Modem lines. It can be used to disconnect the terminal from the
normal serial port and connect it to an internal device. The external serial
port is also available to the device as a plain connector.
